# 🗺️ Project Roadmap: The Sovereign Cloud

> This roadmap describes optional and modular evolution paths.
> Not all phases are intended to live in the core runtime.

This roadmap transforms **Gojinn** from a high-performance runtime into a **Sovereign Cloud Platform**.
Our goal is to replace the fragmented stack of AWS Lambda + SQS + RDS + Kubernetes with a single, secure, and intelligent binary.

### ❌ Explicit Non-Goals
To keep the project focused, we will **NOT** build:
* **No "SaaS-in-a-Box":** We will not build billing engines, payment gateways, or multi-tier subscription logic into the core. Gojinn is an engine, not a storefront.
* Proprietary/Vendor-locked APIs.
* Replacement for heavy OS-level containers (Docker).
* "Magic" opaque networking layers.
