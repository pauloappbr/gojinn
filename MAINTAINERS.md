# Maintainers of Gojinn

This document defines the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of maintainers of the Gojinn project.

Gojinn is governed under a **BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life)** model.
Maintainers exist to **scale trust and review capacity**, not to dilute the project’s technical vision.

---

## 🧭 Roles

### Project Founder (BDFL)

The Project Founder has final authority over:

- Core architecture
- Runtime invariants
- Security model
- Public API boundaries
- Long-term roadmap

The Founder may accept or reject proposals at their discretion, even if technically valid, in order to preserve coherence and long-term integrity.

---

### Maintainers

Maintainers are trusted contributors appointed by the Founder.

They are expected to:

- Review pull requests
- Enforce design invariants and governance rules
- Provide technical guidance to contributors
- Help triage issues and discussions
- Uphold the project’s scope boundaries

Maintainers **do not override** the Founder on matters of:
- Core invariants
- Security model
- Project direction

---

## 🧠 How Maintainers Are Selected

Maintainers are invited, not elected.

Selection is based on:

- Sustained, high-quality contributions
- Demonstrated understanding of Gojinn’s architecture
- Respect for determinism, isolation, and capability-based design
- Constructive communication with the community

There is no fixed quota for maintainers.

---

## 🔐 Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Saying **no** when necessary
- Preventing scope creep
- Protecting public API stability
- Rejecting features that violate the core invariant
- Ensuring experimental features are properly isolated

Maintainers should favor:
- Simplicity over abstraction
- Explicit contracts over implicit behavior
- Correctness over convenience

---

## 🚫 What Maintainers Are NOT Responsible For

Maintainers are **not** expected to:

- Provide user support (see SUPPORT.md)
- Implement requested features
- Maintain forks or downstream integrations
- Guarantee roadmap timelines

---

## ⚠️ Conflict Resolution

In case of disagreement:

1. Discussion should focus on **design principles**, not preferences
2. Maintainers may provide recommendations
3. The Founder makes the final decision

This model prioritizes clarity and velocity over consensus.

---

## 🧾 Inactive Maintainers

Maintainers who become inactive may be marked as inactive by the Founder.

Inactive maintainers:
- Retain recognition
- Lose merge privileges until reactivated

---

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

All maintainers must adhere to the Code of Conduct.

Abuse of authority, dismissive behavior, or repeated violation of project principles may result in removal.

---
